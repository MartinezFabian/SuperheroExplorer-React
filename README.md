# Superhero Explorer

## Description

The "Superhero Explorer" project is a web application that allows users to browse a list of superheroes from both Marvel and DC universes. By clicking on "More...," users can access a detailed hero page, which provides additional information about the selected hero. The application also features a search page that enables users to find a specific hero by name. Furthermore, it includes a login screen designed to simulate a web login (implemented to practice the concept of private routes).

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The project is built using the React JavaScript library, which facilitates the development of dynamic user interfaces.

- **React Router**: React Router is used to manage the application's routing, enabling navigation between different pages.

- **CSS Modules**: CSS Modules are employed for styling to ensure a modular and maintainable design.

- **Jest**: Jest is utilized for testing components and ensuring code reliability.

- **React Testing Library**: This testing library is used for efficient and user-centric component testing.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to apply theoretical knowledge related to various routing concepts and testing in React. Specifically, it focuses on the following aspects:

- **Multiple Routers**: Implementing multiple routers to manage different sections of the application.

- **Reading URL Parameters**: Extracting and utilizing URL parameters for dynamic content.

- **Query Parameters**: Handling query parameters to enable specific searches and interactions.

- **Public Routes**: Implementing public routes accessible to all users.

- **Private Routes**: Creating private routes that require authentication to access.

- **Remembering the Last Visited Route**: Implementing a mechanism to remember and return to the last visited route.

- **Testing Private and Public Routes**: Conducting thorough testing of both public and private routes to ensure functionality and security.
